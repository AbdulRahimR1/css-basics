    Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds.
 There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. 
 The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. 
 People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. 
There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.

 Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that do not have a proper place to the center of the room
Get rid of at least five things that you have not used within the last year.
Take out all of the trash, and place all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen sink.
 Now find a location for each of the items you had placed in the center of the room.
 For any remaining items, see if you can squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your closet. See, that was easy!
